# odin-recipes
This project is made while doing The Odin Project coding course. It contain recipes. In this small project I show that I have learned the basic html code, like: 
- Making a boiler plate
- Dealing with titles, paragraphs and lists
- Making links and including pictures
- Working with git and pushing to github.
