        <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
        <p>Here is a set of my favourite recipes. You will find that most of the recipes are fairly simple to make. I am no alchymist in a kitchen and most of the recipes can be done when you are stressed and have other things on your mind. For the same reasons there are absolutely no baking recipes in this collection. You're welcome.  <p>
        <p>Most of the recipes will have a danish spin on them. This just means that I come from Denmark and are using the ingredients that are available to us in the Danish grocery stores. You will probably know most of the recipes beforehand.<p>
